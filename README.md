# Abstract-Data-Types
 Implementation of Abstract Data Types in Python.

## Data types covered

* Stack (LIFO)
* Queue (FILO)
* Graph
* Tree
* Binary Tree
* Hash Table
* Linked List



## Algorithms included

The following algorithms (for relevant data types) have been implemented so far:

* Graph traversals
  * Breadth-first
  * Depth-first

**A note on DFS**: it does work, but instead of choosing the next node alphabetically, it chooses the last. Nonetheless, it still performs the relevant algorithm!

The following algorithms are still to be implemented:
* Tree traversals
  * Pre-order
  * In-order
  * Post-order
